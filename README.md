# TREKTRKR Starter Kit

## Abstract

TREKTRKR simplifies the way you track and plan your vacation trips.  This visual trip tracker and planner not only lets you see your past trips and associated costs, but also lets you plan and cost out new trips!  Entering a few pieces of information and with the click of a few buttons, you are on your way to booking a trip with your travel agent.  Let the travels begin!

## Preview of App



## Context

I completed this project in the last 2 weeks of of Mod 2 of the Front End development program at Turing School of Software and Design.  This was my final Solo Project for Mod 2 and I completed it remotely over the span of 6 days, putting in over 60 hours on this project.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript written in my VS Code editor with Webpack installed.  GitHub was used not only for storing my code, but also for tracking my project.

I tried to keep the HTML structure small and light and followed the order of the structure in the CSS rules.  JavaScript functions were arranged in different files for easier readability.  Test driven development was implemented with the Mocha framework and Chai library.

## Learning Goals

- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

## Wins + Challenges
- A challenge with a big project like this was breaking it down into small, manageable chunks.  While we were given user stories to guide us, I had to break them down into actionable steps.  I found that creating the data and then following up the data with DOM updates was important.
- Another challenge was keeping the information easy to read in VS Code.  Breaking the Javascript files down into scripts, domUpdates, and user-data helped with readability and made for a lot less scrolling
- A big win was getting the POST to work and then seeing the first booked trip show up on the Trips Dashboard!

## Future Features
- Adding buttons to view trips separately based on past trips, upcoming trips, and pending trips
- Adding another layer where a booking agent can 'approve' trips
- A user can add notes to the trips
- A user can sort the trips by date and cost

## Resources

Josh Comeau's custom CSS Reset is being used to ensure that the app is more clean and will lead to a better user experience.
